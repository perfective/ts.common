# Perfective Common for TypeScript

The code provided by this project relies on the strict [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org) compiler checks.
Use of these packages in the regular JS projects may produce unexpected behavior and is undocumented.
For example,
a function that declares an argument as required relies on strict TSC `null` checks
and does not check value for `null` additionally.

```bash
npm install @perfective/common
```
