= Promise

The `@perfective/common/promise` package provides functions to work with the
`link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise[Promise]` class.

== Reference

=== Types

* `type Resolve<T> = (value: T | PromiseLike<T>) => void`
— a type of a callback called to resolve a `Promise` value.
+
* `type Reject<E extends Error = Error> = (reason?: E) => void`
— a type of a callback called to reject a `Promise` with a `reason`.
+
[NOTE]
====
This type is stricter than the default type of the reject callback,
as it requires an `Error` as a `reason`.
====
+
* `type Executor<T, E extends Error = Error> = (resolve: Resolve<T>, reject: Reject<E>) => void`
— a type of the `executor` callback passed into a `Promise` constructor.


=== Constructors

* `async function promise<T, E extends Error = Error>(executor: Executor<T, E>): Promise<T>`
— creates a new `Promise` with a given `executor` callback.
