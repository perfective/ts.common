== v0.11.0

* *Fixed ES modules imports*.
+
`@perfective/common` can now be imported from regular `.js`/`.mjs` ESM files.
+
* *Added wrappers for most of the `Math` functions* (link:{github-issues}/20[#20])
+
Unlike the standard `Math` functions,
the following functions throw an `Exception` for invalid inputs:
+
** `absolute()`;
** `arccos()`, `arccosh()`;
** `arcsin()`, `arcsinh()`;
** `arctan()`, `arctan2()`, `arctanh()`;
** `cos()`, `cosh()`;
** `sin()`, `sinh()`;
** `tan()`, `tanh()`;
** `rounded()`, `roundedUp()`, `roundedDown()`, `roundedToFloat32()`, `truncated()`;
** `power()`, `powerOf()`;
** `squareRoot()`, `cubeRoot()`, `l2norm()`;
** `exp()`, `expm1()`;
** `log()`, `log10()`, `log1p()`, `log2()`;
** `sign()` with `Sign` nominal type.
+
Replacing `NaN` with `null` is a redundant idea,
because itâ€™s trivial to do use library functions with `Maybe` instead:
+
[source,typescript]
----
maybe(x).to(Math.acos).that(isNumber)
----
+
Meanwhile, throwing an exception gives library users an option to track invalid inputs.
In this case, the `Result` monad can be used:
+
[source,typescript]
----
result(x).onto(resultFrom(arccos))
----
+
* *Added more nominal types for numbers*:
+
** Added `Infinity`, `PositiveInfinity`, and `NegativeInfinity` nominal types
with the `isInfinity()` type guard.
+
** Added `FiniteNumber` nominal type
with the `isFinite() type guard (link:{github-issues}/18[#18])
and `assertIsFinite()` assertion.
+
** Added the `PositiveNumber`, `NonPositiveNumber`, `NegativeNumber`, `NonNegativeNumber` nominal types.
** Added `assertIsNonNegativeNumber()` type guard.
+
* *Introduced assertion function*  (link:{github-issues}/53[#53]):
+
** Added the `assertIsNotNaN()` and `assertIsNonNegativeNumber()` functions.
** Added the `typeException()` function.


== v0.10.0

Changes since *v0.9.0*:

=== `link:{perfective-common}/src/result/index.adoc[@perfective/common/result]`

* Added the `Result.that()` filter method.
* Added the `Result.which()` type-guard method.
* Added the `Result.when()` filter method.
* Added the `Result.or()` fold method.
* Added the `Result.otherwise()` recovery method.
** Deprecated the `recovery()` function.
+
* *[Breaking]* Changed the `resultFrom()` to use `try-catch` instead of the `T | Error` union type.
+
This makes the function behavior safer and allows wider usage.


=== New `link:{perfective-common}/src/date/index.adoc[@perfective/common/date]` package

* Added functions for the `Date` class:
** Added `date()`, `now()`, and `epoch()` `Date` constructors.
** Added `isValid()`/`isInvalid()` `Date` predicates.
+
* Added `Timestamp` type.
** Added `timestamp()` constructor.


=== Restructured Roadmap

`link:{perfective-common}/ROADMAP.adoc[ROADMAP.adoc]`
now contains all built-in objects with their properties and methods.
Some of the methods and properties already have a matching Perfective function,
and some are marked as prohibited (e.g. `eval`) or not supported.

The Roadmap will document minimum support to tag `@perfective/common` `v1.0`.


=== Breaking changes

as it is no longer supported.
+

== v0.9.0

Changes since v0.8.3.

** Added the `result()`, `success()`, and `failure()` constructors.
** Added the `resultOf()` lazy constructor.
** Added the `resultFrom()`, `successFrom()`, and `failureFrom()` functions.

*** and `isFailure()`/`isNotFailure()`.
+
* Added the `BiMapResult<T, U>` type for the `Result.to(maps)` method:
** Added the `successWith()` and `failureWith()` `BiMapResult` constructors.
+
* Added the `BiFoldResult<T, U>` type for the `Result.into(fold)` method.
* Added the `BiVoidResult<T>` type for the `Result.through(procedures)` method.


=== Breaking changes

* `@perfective/common/function`:
** Changed the `same()` function into a unary function.
+
To migrate:
+
*** replace calls passing the `same` as an argument with `constant(same)`;
*** replace calls of the `same()` with just `same`.
+
* `@perfective/common/object`:
** Narrowed argument to the `NonNullable` type in the:
*** `pick()`/`recordWithPicked()`,
*** `omit()`/`recordWithOmitted()`,
*** and `filter()`/`recordFiltered()` functions.


=== Deprecations

* `@perfective/common/array`:
** Merged the `flatten()` function into the `concatenated()` function.
** Merged the `arrayFromIterable()` and `arrayFromArrayLike()` functions into the new `elements()` function.

+
* `@perfective/common/maybe`:
** Renamed the `Maybe.run()` method into the `Maybe.through()` method.
** Deprecated the `Nullable` and `Optional` types.
+
Both types cover specific edge cases for the `Maybe` type.
But they have not been used in real-world applications.
Use cases that these types covered can be handled by `Maybe`,
so there is no good reason to maintain them.
+
*** Deprecated `nil()`, `nullable()`, `only()`, and `solum()` functions.
*** Deprecated `none()`, `optional()`, and `some()` functions.
*** Deprecated `lift()` function.
+
** Deprecated the `Maybe.lift()` method.
+
Use the `Maybe.into()` method with the `maybeFrom()` function instead.
+
* `@perfective/common/promise`:
** Renamed the `Run` type into `Executor`.
+
ECMA specification uses the term `executor`.
+
** Renamed the `result()` function into `settlement()`.
+
* `@perfective/common/string`:
** Deprecated the `Output` interface.
** Deprecated the `output()`, `isOutput()`, and `isNotOutput()` functions.
+
Use the `String()` function for native string coercion instead.


=== Improvements

* Removed mock files from the distribution.
+
`mock.ts` files are only imported in tests.
+
* `@perfective/common`:
** Added support of abstract classes to the `isInstanceOf()`/`isNotInstanceOf()` type guards.
** Added the `Voidable<T>` type.
** Added the `ecmaType()` and `isEcmaType()` functions.
** Added the `tsType()` and `isTsType()` functions.
** Added the `present()`, `notNull()`, and `defined()` functions.
** Set `Present<T>` as the `isPresent()` function return value.
** Set `Defined<T>` as the `isDefined()` function return value.
** Set `NotNull<T>` as the `isNotNull()` function return value.
+
* `@perfective/common/array`:
** Added the `pushInto()` function.

* `@perfective/common/error`:
** Fixed the `Exception` class prototype for
the https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#inheriting-built-in-types[ES5 compilation].
** Added the `chained()` function.
** Included a non-error value output into an `unknownError()` message.
+
* `@perfective/common/function`:
** Added the `BiMap<T1, U1, T2, V2>` arguments pair type.
** Added the `BiFold<T1, T2, U>` arguments pair type.
** Added the `Void` and `UnaryVoid<T>` procedure types.
+
* `@perfective/common/match`:
** Added the `caseFromEntry()` function.
+
* `@perfective/common/maybe`:
** Added `Maybe.into(reduce)` method and `into(reduce)` function.
** Added `maybeFrom()` and `justFrom()` functions.
** Narrowed signatures for the `maybe()` function.
+
When a function is given an always present value, it will return `Just<T>`,
and for always absent values, it will return `Nothing<T>`.
+
Otherwise, the `Maybe` type is compiled as an interface and cannot be checked with the `instance of` in runtime.
+
** Added JSDocs for the `Maybe` type methods.
** Changed error messages for absent values in `Just`.
** Switch to `extends` instead of `implements` in `Maybe`
** Added type guards:
*** `isMaybe()`/`isNotMaybe()`,
*** `isJust()`/`isNotJust()`,
*** and `isNothing()`/`isNotNothing()`.
+
* `@perfective/common/object`:
** Added the `hasMethod()` and `hasNoMethod()` functions.
** Changed the `isRecord()` predicate to be a type guard.
** Marked property definition in the `ObjectWithUndefined` type as optional.
+
Required to work with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`.
Otherwise, an object with a never defined property cannot be assigned to an object with a property set to undefined.
+
The type guard is not yet strict enough, but it is better than just a predicate.
+
* `@perfective/common/promise`:
** Added the `Resolvable` shortcut type.
** Added the `OnFulfilled` and `OnRejected` types.
** Added the `fulfilled()` and `rejected()` functions.
** Added the `settled()` function.
